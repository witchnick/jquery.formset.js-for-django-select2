# jquery.formset.js-for-django-select2
This is a jquery.formset.js version working with select2 fields generated by django-select2

If You use formsets with clonning forms row by row without external template
as it was suggested in django-select2 then this code will suits Your needs. 

Django-select2 generates input in place of select and adds some JS code responsible 
for adding 'select2-container' div which works as a select. 

Standard jquery.formset.js is clonning previous form with input and JS code but without  
'select2-container'. In this case JS code doesnt work because it refers to input from 
previous form. 
This version of jquery.formset.js improves fieldID and launches the JS code to 
generate appropriate 'select2-container'.
